    The fire is assumed to be distributed uniformly over the tray width and
    spreads only along the tray, away from the fire seat. Due to preheating
    of the upper trays, the burning area forms a V-shape of propagating flame
    and extinction fronts. Affected surface depends on the vertical distance
